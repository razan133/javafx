        //listEmployees => have objects of Employee (the data source of stream pipeline)
        //.stream => to have stream of these employees move through a sequence of processing steps - pipeline-
        //.filter => filter the stream to have only elements that satisfy the condition
        //only employees they have salary between >=800 and <1200
        //.map => maps each element in the stream to a new value (each -e- employee will refere to 
        //a new Employee object that have replacmentâ€™s data -- id ,name , department --
        //and update new salary by 2% plus) (plus 2% at salary to each employee)
        //.collect => collecting the results elements of the previous opreations each according to its
        //department in a group and its counting
        //.forEach => print each department with its count of employees
